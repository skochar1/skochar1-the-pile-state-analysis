# The Pile: US State Analysis
Contains:
* Sentiments probe
* Emotions probe
* Several CSV data files with labels on GPT-J generated sentences
* Graphs/visual models for trends observed on data observed

## Key takeaways:
* Many more negatively labeled sentences than positively labeled sentences in general
* Coastal regions yielded slightly less negative outcomes and slightly more positive outcomes
* High tax regions yielded slightly less negative outcomes and slightly more positive outcomes
* More anger correlated with Plains
* More fear correlated with Southeast and Coastal areas... (tbf)

Explanations:
* Need more data, stronger computing power and higher GPU RAM (that was one issue I ran into on this project with my computer specifically)
* Need to make the Pile include more information on states that isn't just from the news and from history books; 
* Probing tasks need to be refined to be more neutral/equally likely to produce all three types of sentiment
